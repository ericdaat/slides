    # Introduction
    Python is awesome.

    Built by Guido Van Rossum in 1989... because he was bored:

    > *Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).*

    > -- Guido Van Rossum, 1996

    # Introduction
    
    These few slides just aim at demonstrating a few Python concepts that I find useful.

    Few things worth mentioning:

    1. This is absolutely not exhaustive.

    2. You can learn more about Python [here](https://www.python.org/).

    3. I personally started learning it by reading [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)

    4. For Mac users, it is recommended to **not** use the built in macOS Python. Instead, do the following:
        - Get [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the missing package manager for macOS
        - Run ``` brew install python```

    ## Object Oriented Programming

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## Simple Class

    Create a basic class `MyClass` with a constructor `__init__` 
    that takes no argument. Our class is very simple and has
    no attribute.

    ``` python
    class MyClass(object):
        def __init__(self):
            pass

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        my_class = MyClass()    # call to the __init__ constructor
    ```

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## Passing arguments

    Improve our class by changing the constructor and adding arguments.

    ``` python
    class MyClass(object):
        def __init__(self, arg):
            self.arg = arg

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        my_class = MyClass(1)   # call to the __init__ constructor
        print my_class.arg      # will print 1
    ```

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## Calling methods

    Adding an instance method to our class

    ``` python
    class MyClass(object):
        def __init__(self, arg):
            self.arg = arg

        def some_method(self, value):
            return value

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        my_class = MyClass(1)
        print my_class.some_method(3)      # will print 3
    ```

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## Inheritance

    Create two Classes `A` and `B`, where `B` inherits from `A`. Notice
    how `B` can use `a_method` even though it is defined in `A`.

    ``` python
    class A(object):
        def __init__(self, arg):
            self.arg = arg
        
        def a_method(self, value):
            return value

    class B(A):
        def __init__(self, arg):
            super(B, self).__init__(arg)    # calls A constructor with arg

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        b = B(1)                            # creates A then B
        print b.a_method(3)                 # will print 3
    ```

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## Overidding

    Same `A` and `B` Classes, but this time we override
    `A.a_method` in `B`

    ``` python
    class A(object):
        def __init__(self, arg):
            self.arg = arg
        
        def a_method(self, value):
            return value

    class B(A):
        def __init__(self, arg):
            super(B, self).__init__(arg)    # calls A constructor with arg

        def a_method(self, value):          # overriding a_method
            return value * 2

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        b = B(1)                            # creates A then B
        print b.a_method(3)                 # will print 6
    ```

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## **instance method** vs. Class method

    An instance method is called on an instance of the Class.  
    Here, `Animal` is our class, and `bob` is an instance of `Animal`.

    ``` python
    class Animal(object):
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

        def say_my_name(self):
            return self.name

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        bob = Animal("Bob")
        print bob.say_my_name()      # will print "Bob"
    ```

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## instance method vs. **Class method**

    A Class method however, is called on the Class itself.

    ``` python
    class Animal(object):
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

        @classmethod
        def introduce(cls):
            return "I am {0}".format(cls)

        def say_my_name(self):
            return self.name

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print Animal.introduce()    # will print "I am <class '__main__.Animal'>"
    ```

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## Public vs. private

    Methods and attributes are public by default in python. Adding a `_` makes
    them private:  
     - `self.name` vs. `self._name` for attributes
     - `def some_method(self)` vs. `def _some_method(self)` for methods


    ``` python
    class Animal(object):
        def __init__(self, name, credit_card_code):
            self.name = name
            self._credit_card_code = credit_card_code

        def _do_something_private(self):
            pass

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        bob = Animal("Bob", 1234)
        print bob.name                  # will print "Bob"
        print bob.credit_card_code      # will crash
        bob.do_something_private()      # will crash
    ```

    ---

    # Object Oriented Programming
    ## Accessing private attributes: getter & setter

    When defining private attributes, we can access them with getters,
    and redefine them with setters.


    ``` python
    class SomeClass(object):
        def __init__(self, value):
            self._private_attribute = value

        @property
        def private_attribute(self):
            return self._private_attribute

        @private_attribute.setter
        def private_attribute(self, new_value):
            self._private_attribute = new_value

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        c = SomeClass(1)
        print c.private_attribute     # will print 1
        c.private_attribute = 2
        print c.private_attribute     # will print 2
    ```

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Comprehension lists

    Creating arrays faster and in a more elegant way.

    ``` python
    # The ugly way:
    l = []
    for i in range(5):
        l.append(i)
    # l = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


    # The list comprehension way:
    l = [i for i in range(5)]
    # l = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


    # Works with dicts too !
    d = {str(i):i for i in range(5)}
    # d = {'1': 1, '0': 0, '3': 3, '2': 2, '4': 4}

    ```

    ---

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Enumerate

    An elegant way to iterate over an iterable object

    ``` python
    l = [10, 20, 30]

    # The ugly way:
    for i in range(len(l)):
        print i, l[i]               # will print 0, 10 then 1, 20 etc ...


    # The enumerate way:
    for i, item in enumerate(l):    # enumerate(l) = [(0, 10), ...]
        print i, item               # print the same thing, but nicer !
    ```

    ---

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Map functions

    Apply a function to every item of an iterable object (e.g. arrays).

    ``` python
    l = [1, 2, 3]           # l is an iterable object

    def f(value):           # function to apply to l items
        return 2 * value


    # The ugly way:
    new_l = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        new_l.append(f(l))
    # new_l = [2, 4, 6]


    # The map way:
    new_l = map(f, l)
    # new_l = [2, 4, 6]

    ```

    ---

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Lambda functions

    Create anonymous functions.

    ``` python
    l = [1, 2, 3]

    def f(value):
        return 2 * value

    print map(f, l) 
    ```

    Do we really need to declare a function for such an easy operation ? Nope.

    ``` python
    l = [1, 2, 3]

    print map(lambda r: r*2, l)     # will print [2, 4, 6]
    ```

    ---

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Partial functions

    Functions used in map can only take a single argument. What if we have more ?
    Here, we learn to create a partial function filled with some constant 
    arguments and leave one free, so we can map values on it.

    ``` python
    from functools import partial

    l = [1,2,3]

    def f(value, coefficient):          # would be hard to map huh ?
        return value * coefficient

    fp = partial(f, coefficient=2)      # fp = f(value, coefficient=2)

    print map(fp, l)                    # will print [2, 4, 6]

    ```

    ---

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Multiprocessing with Pool

    Multi process a function with multiprocessing.Pool

    ``` python
    from multiprocessing import Pool
    import time

    def f(value):
        time.sleep(1)
        return value

    l = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    p = Pool(4)         # say we have 4 cores --> 4 processes

    map(f, l)           # would take 4 seconds
    p.map(f, l)         # would take 1 second

    ```

    ---

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Handling Exceptions: with try & except

    Things will break.

    ``` python
    l = [1, 2, 3, None]

    for i, item in enumerate(l):
        print l + 1     # will crash when item=None
    ```

    Handle exceptions:

    ``` python
    l = [1, 2, 3, None]

    for i, item in enumerate(l):
        try:
            print l + 1
        except:     # Will catch any exception (KeyError, ValueError, etc...)
            print "Something went wrong"
    ```

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Assertions

    Checks boolean expressions, raises exception when False.

    ``` python
    assert(2>=1)     # works
    assert(2<=1)     # raises AssertionError
    ```

    Useful for parameter checking:
    ```python
    def f(value):
        try:
            assert(isinstance(value, int))
        except AssertionError:
            raise ValueError("value must be integer")

        return value + 1

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print f(2)      # will print 3
        print f("hi")   # will raise ValueError
    ```

    ## Logging

    Are you using `print` for logging ? Stop right now.

    ``` python
    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(
        format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s:%(message)s',
        level=logging.DEBUG)     # minimum logging level

    logging.info("this is info") # prints 2017-05-11 17:36:33,141 INFO:this is info
    ```

    Be careful with the logging level.

    ``` python
    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(
        format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s:%(message)s',
        level=logging.INFO)        # minimum logging level

    logging.debug("this is debug") # won't be displayed because DEBUG < INFO
    ```

    # Useful funtions & concepts
    ## Generators

    A generator produces a sequence of results and not the full array. Hence, we never load a full array in memory.

    ``` python
    def yrange(n):
        i = 0
        while i < n:    # the loop doesn't run all at once, it waits for next()
            yield i
            i += 1

    y = yrange(3)       # generator object
    print y.next()      # prints 0
    print y.next()      # prints 1
    print y.next()      # prints 2
    print y.next()      # raises Error
    ```

    # Structure of a project
    ## `__init__.py`

    This is where the main function starts

    ```python
    def main():
        # main function
        pass

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # this is the entrypoint of the code
        main()
    ```

    ---

    # Structure of a project
    ## Modules

    Let's say we defined a function `some_function` within 
    the `my_module.__init__.py` file. This function is now part
    of a module beautifully called `my_module`.

    ``` shell
    my_python_project/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── my_module
        └── __init__.py
    ```

    `my_python_project.__init__.py` : 
    ``` python
    from my_module import some_function

    def main():
        some_function()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

    ## Virtual Environments

    ---

    # Virtual Environments
    ## What is it ?

    From [virtualenv documentation](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/):
    > A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating virtual Python environments for them. It solves the “Project X depends on version 1.x but, Project Y needs 4.x” dilemma, and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable.

    You should never **sudo** pip install something:
    ``` console
    $ sudo pip install whatever                     # bad
    ```

    Instead, pip install any library you want **inside** a virtualenv:
    ``` console
    $ (your-virtualenv) pip install whatever        # good
    ```
    ---

    # Virtual Environments
    ## Getting started

    Install virtualenv with pip
    ``` shell
    $ pip install virtualenv  # you may need sudo
    ```

    Create a virtualenv somewhere in your file system:
    ``` shell
    $ virtualenv your-virtualenv  # will create a your-virtualenv folder
    ```

    Activate it:
    ``` shell
    $ source your-virtualenv/bin/activate
    $ (your-virtualenv) pip list # check what's inside
    ```

    You're free ! Install whatever you want !
    ``` shell
    $ (your-virtualenv) pip install pandas
    ```

    ---

    # Virtual Environments
    ## It gets better

    You can use whatever python you want !
    ```shell
    $ virtualenv your-virtualenv -p python3
    ```

    Export all you pip libraries to a .txt file:
    ```shell
    $ (your-virtualenv) pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

    Install back your pip libraries in another virtualenv:
    ```shell
    $ (your-virtualenv2) pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
